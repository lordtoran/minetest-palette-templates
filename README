*** 16x16 palette editing templates for Minetest ***

These templates are meant to ease the process of creating 16x16 textures by providing a color palette directly on the image canvas. This way basic colors can be selected using the color picker tool in GIMP or other image editors.

Palette editing templates are 34x16 pixels. On the left hand is a 16x16 space containing a color palette composed of up to 256 colors, next to that a 2 pixel wide high-contrast but unintrusive separator, and on the right side the actual 16x16 workspace.

Palette and workspace are separate layers to guard against accidental color picking or painting on the palette.

Palette templates contained in the archive are:

--- 6-8-5-fl-gr ---

Based on a regular 6-8-5 RGB palette (the numbers designating the number of levels for each R/G/B primary)[1]. Thus, the palette contains 240 (6x8x5) colors, which leaves just enough remaining space for 8 shades of flesh and 8 shades of gray (as the base palette does not contain pure grays).

--- a2600ntscderiv ---

Derived from the Atari 2600's full 128 colors palette available only in NTSC video format[2]. All hues are stretched x2 except of the grays (also including white and black) in order to leave space for 6 flesh hues.

--- colormap-fl-gr ---

Just a neatly downsampled 2D colormap of the full HSV colorspace[3], with a little space left to accommodate ten grays (including black and white) as well as 6 flesh tones.

--- cp4deriv-fl ---

Derived from the Commodore Plus/4 resp. C16 121 color palette[4]. Hues stretched to obtain a near-256 color palette. Leftover blacks were filled up with flesh tones.

--- dp4 ---

Deluxe Paint 4 default palette[5].

--- hsv-fl-gr ---

Based on a palette evenly distributed over the HSV colorspace but without much lightness variation. Some fleshes and full grayscale with white and black added.[5]

--- hsv-stretched-fl-gr ---

Downsampled HSV colorspace with reduced number of hues but more lightness variation[6]. Some grays and fleshes added.

--- msx2 ---

Screen mode 8 palette of the MSX2 computer [4][5]. It is a plain 8-8-4 levels RGB palette without true grays that takes up all 256 possible colors.

--- osdl-mod-fl-gr ---

Modification of a palette found in the OSDL (Object-oriented Simple DirectMedia Library) online documentation on Sourceforge[7]. Obviously it is a plain 6-8-5 levels RGB palette with 240 colors. Original author's fleshes, blues and grays at the end of the palette replaced with custom fleshes and grays.
